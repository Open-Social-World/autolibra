The agent did not attempt to reposition any blocks to form a win condition, which is appropriate given the task setup, making this metric not applicable.","irrelevant_block_avoidance_reasoning":"The agent focused solely on moving toward the key and did not interact with any irrelevant or immovable blocks. This selective attention to strategic elements shows that the agent avoids unnecessary interactions.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"The agent evaluated the current state of the game carefully, recognized that the path to the key was unimpeded, and chose a direct action (moving left) to pursue the win condition.

{"effective_wall_rule_interpretation_reasoning":"The agent repeatedly identifies that the 'wall is stop' rule is present and that it is interfering with progress.

Although the subsequent movement becomes repetitive, the agent does show a clear recognition of the wall rule’s effects and attempts to counteract it.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"Over the entire trajectory the agent never makes a deliberate attempt to reposition blocks (like the ball, key, or is block) to create a winning rule (e.g. 'ball is win' or 'key is win'). Despite acknowledging that the win condition is inactive, no concrete block manipulation is attempted to change the rules into a win condition.","irrelevant_block_avoidance_reasoning":"The agent’s behavior is dominated by movements and attempts to remove or modify the 'wall is stop' rule, rather than selectively interacting with blocks that directly contribute to the win condition.

This suggests that the agent was not effectively adjusting its strategy in response to the evolving game state.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The observations throughout the trajectory indicate that the win condition remains inactive, yet the agent does not clearly pick out or target a specific win candidate (e.g., moving deliberately to reposition the key or ball to form a win rule). There is no clear, coordinated plan to link the win objects into an active win rule.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"The agent explicitly reasons about the need to remove the 'wall is stop' rule and repeatedly attempts to move toward the block that must be manipulated. Although the motion becomes cluttered with redundant moves, the focus on modifying the problematic rule shows that the basic idea of rule modification to manage obstacles is understood.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"Rather than taking a direct and efficient route toward a target, the agent’s actions consist of many repeated and looping moves (back and forth between up, left, down, etc.) that do not clearly reduce the distance to any specific win condition. This indicates poor efficiency in navigation.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"The agent breaks the task into sub-objectives in its initial reasoning but fails to coordinate these into a coherent plan that leads to victory.
