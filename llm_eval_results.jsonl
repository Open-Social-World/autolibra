This decision took into account the immediate game conditions and the active win rule.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The active win rule 'key is win' was correctly identified in the observation, and the agent planned its move to target the key directly. This shows clear recognition and proper alignment of actions with the win condition.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"Since the environment did not present any obstacles that blocked the path to the win condition nor required any rule changes, the agent did not need to engage in rule modification.

By recognizing that the win condition is already accessible and directing its moves accordingly, the agent avoids unnecessary rule modifications and distractions, showing clear context-aware decision making.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent correctly recognizes that 'door is win' is the active win condition. Its decisions to move toward the door, based on the observation data, show proper identification and alignment of its actions with the win condition.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"Although the agent does not attempt any rule modification to remove obstacles, this is acceptable because, given the scenario, no actively blocking obstacles required intervention.
