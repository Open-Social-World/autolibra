You are an expert evaluator tasked with analyzing agent trajectories and human feedback to identify and define relevant evaluation metrics.

Context:
Review the following task metadata, agent metadata, and its trajectory, and several metrics that you should use to evaluate the agent's performa

Agent Trajectory:
{{ trajectory }}

Metrics:
{% for metric in metrics %}

Metric name: {{ metric.name }}
Metric description: {{ metric.explanation }}
Metric good behaviors: {{ metric.good_behaviors }}
Metric bad behaviors: {{ metric.bad_behaviors }}


{% endfor %}


Instructions:
1. Analyze the agent task and trajectory carefully
2. Understand the metrics provided, and figure out which part of the trajectory they might be relevant to
3. Output two things for each metric:
   - A reasoning for why you think the agent either did well or poorly on the metric
      - If you think the agent did well, provide the behavior of the agent that led you to that conclusion
      - If you think the agent did poorly, provide the behavior of the agent that led you to that conclusion
      - If you think the metric is not applicable to the agent, provide a reasoning for that
   - A string indicating whether you think the agent did well or poorly on the metric
      - "1" indicates the agent did well
      - "0" indicates the metric is not applicable to the agent
      - "-1" indicates the agent did poorly

Output the following:
