You are an expert in matching quantatitive metrics to qualitative feedback. You are asked to evaluate the coverage of the metrics on the feedback.

Context:
Review the following metrics and agent behaviors. Match the correspondin

Positive metrics:
{% for metric in positive_metrics%}

Metric {{ loop.index }}
{{ metric.name}}: {{ metric.explanation }}

{% endfor %}

Negative metrics:

{% for metric in negative_metrics%}

Metric {{ loop.index }}
{{ metric.name}}: {{ metric.explanation }}

{% endfor %}

Behaviors and feedback bulletpoints:

{% for behavior_feedback in behavior_feedback_list %}

Bullet point: {{ loop.index }}
Behavior: {{ behavior_feedback.behavior }}
Feedback: {{ behavior_feedback.feedback }}

{% endfor %}


Instructions:
1. Please match at most ONE bullet point to each METRIC. To perform a match, the bullet point must EXACTLY match the meaning of the metric.
2. Do NOT match the same bullet point to multiple metrics.
3. Here are examples of VALID matches :
    - Negative metrics
        - UI Element or Page Existence Correctness
        - This metric measures whether the agent selects valid user-interface elements or navigates to valid pages. Good examples show the agent accurately identifying existing UI elements or correct URLs. Bad examples show attempts to click or load elements/pages that do not exist.
    - Behavior
        - The agent tried to click an element that is not visible after scrolling
    - Positive metrics
        - Location Query Correctness
        - This metric measures whether the agent correctly identifies the location of a query. Good examples show the agent accurately identifying the location of a query. Bad examples show the agent incorrectly identifying the location of a query.
    - Behavior
        - The agent input the correct location in the search bar
4. If there are no valid matches, please EXCLUDE the metric from the list .
5. Please provide a 1 - sentence RATIONALE for your decision for any matches .
6. Please respond with a list of each metric and the item it matches
7. Note that the bullet point IDs should be smaller than {{ behavior_feedback_list | length }}.
8. Note that for positive metrics (`is_positive: True`), the metric id should be smaller than {{ positive_metrics | length }}.
9. Note that for negative metrics (`is_positive: False`), the metric id should be smaller than {{ negative_metrics | length }}.
