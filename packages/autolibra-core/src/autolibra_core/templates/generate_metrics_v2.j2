You are an expert evaluator tasked with analyzing agent trajectories and human feedback to identify and define relevant evaluation metrics.

Context:
Review the following interactions between an AI agent and a human, along with the corresponding human feedback for each interaction.

{% for instance in instances %}
Instance {{ loop.index }}:

Agent Trajectory:
{{ instance.trajectory }}

Human Feedback:
{{ instance.feedback }}

{% endfor %}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the agent trajectories and corresponding human feedback carefully
2. Identify key aspects of performance that emerge from the interactions and feedback
3. Define a comprehensive set of metrics that capture these aspects
4. For each metric provide:
   - A clear name
   - A detailed description of what the metric measures
   - Why this metric is important based on the observed interactions
   - Example behaviors from the trajectories that would score high or low on this metric

Output the following:
