However, as the trajectory unfolds, the agent engages in repetitive and non-adaptive movements rather than adjusting its strategy based on the current context, leading to inefficient and context-insensitive decision making.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"Although the initial plan mentions that the win condition must be built (by pushing the key block next to the is block), no effective interaction or repositioning of the necessary blocks is observed in the trajectory. The agent never actively manipulates the blocks to produce a 'key is win' outcome, indicating a failure in win rule construction.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"The agent’s actions largely consist of movement commands rather than targeted interactions with the relevant objects (such as the key or rule blocks needed to form the win condition). This lack of selective engagement shows that the agent is not focusing on the objects that could directly contribute to puzzle resolution.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"The agent demonstrates an understanding of when a rule needs to be altered by moving toward and effectively removing the 'wall is stop' rule. This initial successful manipulation stands out in the strategy. However, apart from this early clear action, subsequent behaviors do not include further precise or goal-directed rule modifications.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"While the initial strategy outlines a sequence (remove blocking rule, then construct the win rule), the overall trajectory devolves into a series of repetitive movements that do not effectively advance the sub-tasks. The agent fails to coordinate its actions to move systematically toward forming or reaching the win condition, indicating poor overall task planning.","win_condition_recognition":-1,"rule_modification_for_obstacle_management":1,"direct_navigation_efficiency":-1,"context-sensitive_decision_making":-1,"win_rule_construction":-1,"selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects":-1,"rule_manipulation_and_execution":1,"subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning":-1}
{"win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent’s initial reasoning correctly identified that 'key is win' is active and noted that the key object was unobstructed. The initial action of moving right was consistent with this recognition. However, the later movements become disorganized and do not clearly maintain a direct path toward the key. Overall, the win condition was recognized correctly.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"The agent did not modify any rules because the win condition ('key is win') was already active and the key was not blocked. Since no obstacles required intervention, no rule modifications were attempted, which is acceptable given the circumstances.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"Instead of following a direct route to the key, the agent repeatedly issues movements in various directions (right, down, left, up) that do not steadily reduce the distance toward the win object. This indicates inefficient navigation with unnecessary and repetitive moves.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"The agent fails to adjust its decision making based on the spatial context. Although the win rule was already clear, the agent does not consistently choose actions that bring it closer to the key and instead makes extraneous moves that suggest a lack of situational awareness.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"Since the win condition ‘key is win’ was already active, there was no need to physically rearrange blocks to form a new win rule. The agent did not engage in any block manipulation; thus, this metric is not applicable in this scenario.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"Throughout the trajectory, the agent limits its behavior to movement and does not interact with objects unrelated to the win condition. However, there is also no focused interaction with critical objects (e.g., no block rearrangement when it might have been beneficial) so the selective interaction metric is not clearly applicable here.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"The agent does not perform any rule manipulation or execution. Given that the active win rule was already in place and no obstacles demanded rule changes, the lack of rule manipulation is acceptable, making this metric not applicable in this scenario.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"The trajectory exhibits a highly repetitive sequence of movements with multiple changes in direction that do not form a coherent, strategic progression toward the key.

{"win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent correctly observed and interpreted the active win rule 'door is win' in the initial observation and oriented its actions toward the door object. The first action explicitly stated moving left based on that interpretation.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"The agent did not attempt any modification of rules because it observed that no walls were actually obstructing the path to the door. In this case, there was no need for rule modification, so the metric is not applicable.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"Although the agent identified the door as the goal, its movement sequence was inefficient. Instead of taking a direct path (for example, a clear sequence of left and down moves), the agent made several extraneous moves (e.g., unnecessary ups and downs) that deviated from an optimal route.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"The agent’s decisions did not seem to adapt well to the immediate spatial context. After identifying the door as the target, its subsequent actions involved repeating moves that did not systematically reduce the distance to the door, indicating a lack of refined planning according to the context.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"The win condition was already established as 'door is win' and the agent never attempted to interact with or rearrange blocks to construct a win rule. Because there was no need for constructing a win rule in this environment, this metric is not applicable.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"The agent focused strictly on movement and did not engage with extraneous objects or blocks that were irrelevant to achieving the win condition. This indicates selective interaction, as it did not waste actions on irrelevant elements.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"The agent did not perform any explicit rule manipulation or execution actions, such as attempting to break or reposition blocks. Given that the environment did not force a rule change (the door was accessible without bypassing obstacles), this behavior renders the metric not applicable.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"While the agent recognized the win condition early on, its overall strategy and sequencing were poorly coordinated. The trajectory shows redundant and erratic moves that do not effectively converge on the door, reflecting weak overall planning.","win_condition_recognition":1,"rule_modification_for_obstacle_management":0,"direct_navigation_efficiency":-1,"context-sensitive_decision_making":-1,"win_rule_construction":0,"selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects":1,"rule_manipulation_and_execution":0,"subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning":-1}
{"win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent correctly identified the active win condition ('door is win') in the initial observation and stated that the door is blocked, which is why it attempted to modify the rule. This indicates that it was aware of what it needed to achieve. However, after this recognition, its subsequent moves were not clearly directed solely toward the win object, but the initial recognition is correct.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"The agent’s plan mentioned moving toward the wall block to remove the 'wall is stop' rule, showing an intent to modify the rule that was obstructing progress. However, the trajectory devolves into a long series of repetitive movements that do not clearly execute a rule-modification step. This messy execution indicates a failure to manage obstacles effectively.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"Instead of taking a clear, direct path toward the door or toward a rule block that would modify the obstacle, the agent takes numerous and meandering moves (repetitive 'left', 'up', 'right' and 'down' actions) that do not appear to reduce the distance efficiently toward the target. This shows inefficiency in planning a direct route.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"While the agent initially recognized the need to remove the 'wall is stop' rule, it showed little adaptation based on updated observations. The repeated, almost cyclic movements indicate a lack of context-sensitive adjustment, as the agent failed to switch strategy intelligently when obstacles persisted and conditions did not change as expected.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"The task environment contains rule blocks (like the ones for 'door', 'is', and 'win') that could be manipulated to form or modify the win condition if needed. The agent did not interact with these blocks in a deliberate way to construct or reconstruct the necessary win rule. There is no evidence of purposeful block rearrangement to build the win condition.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"Although the agent’s early reasoning did mention interacting with rule blocks (specifically the wall related rules), the overwhelming sequence of movements suggests that the agent did not selectively interact with objects that would contribute toward solving the puzzle. The repeated directional moves indicate a lack of focus on interacting meaningfully with the relevant blocks.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"The agent verbally recognizes that the 'wall is stop' rule is an obstacle and plans to remove it, which is on the right track. However, over the course of its trajectory it engages in a long series of moves without clear, discrete actions that modify or reposition any rule blocks. The intended rule manipulation is not executed effectively.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"The agent’s initial plan was to remove the 'wall is stop' rule to open the pathway to the door, indicating some degree of subtask segmentation.

Since the path to the key was unobstructed, the agent had no need to modify any blocking rules. This behavior makes the metric not applicable rather than poor performance.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"The agent executed a two-step sequence (down then left) that directly corresponds to the position of the key (1 step down and 1 step left). This indicates efficient and purposeful navigation towards the win target.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"The agent appropriately assessed that no obstacles required interference, and it followed a straightforward plan by moving directly towards the key. This reflects good context-sensitive decision making.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"There was no action involved in constructing or rearranging blocks to form the win condition because the win rule 'key is win' was already active.
