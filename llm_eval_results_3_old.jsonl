This shows a competent approach to modifying game rules in order to manage obstacles, even though the execution sometimes becomes repetitive.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"Although the agent does eventually move toward the key, its navigation is marred by significant repetition and redundant movements. Multiple consecutive 'right' moves are issued and there are loops in the intended path, indicating less-than-optimal path planning.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"The agent divides its task into subtasks—namely, removing the blocking rule and then navigating toward the key—but the plan lacks smooth coordination. It often reverts to previous plans and repeats movement commands, reflecting inefficient sequencing despite an overall logical goal.","interaction_with_immovable_obstacles_reasoning":"The agent shows proper understanding of which objects are immovable (like static walls) by not trying to push them and instead focuses on rule modifications to bypass their effects.

There were many available rule blocks but no attempt was made to create or reconfigure the win condition, making this metric not applicable.","irrelevant_block_avoidance_reasoning":"Throughout the trajectory, the agent focuses on the blocks that are directly relevant (namely the ones related to 'wall is stop') and avoids interacting with blocks that do not contribute to reaching the win condition (like the key or unrelated rule blocks).","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"The agent showed an ability to recognize the key obstacle (the wall rule) and tried to address it, but its plan was inconsistent. The strategy oscillated between trying to modify the rule and navigating directly toward the ball, leading to several redundant and conflicting moves.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent consistently identified that the win condition was provided by 'ball is win' and targeted the ball (at (9,6)) as the victory object. The reasoning reliably noted that the ball was the object to approach once obstacles were cleared.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"The agent repeatedly planned actions to interact with the rule blocks (the 'stop' block in particular) to disable the 'wall is stop' rule. This shows an understanding that the rule needed to be changed to allow progress, even though the execution sometimes involved repeated moves.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"Although the agent eventually reached the goal, its path was full of redundant and back‐and‐forth moves. Rather than following a direct route to the ball after the obstacle was removed, the trajectory includes multiple detours that indicate inefficient navigation.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"The overall strategy involved identifying both the need to remove an obstacle and then move toward the ball. However, the execution was scattered with multiple attempts to interact with rule blocks and revisiting the same actions, which shows a lack of clear subtask coordination and planning.","interaction_with_immovable_obstacles_reasoning":"The agent correctly recognized that certain elements, such as actual walls or immovable blocks, should not be pushed and made no futile attempts to interact with these.

This inconsistent interpretation indicates confusion in handling wall-related rules.","win_rule_construction_reasoning":"The agent does not take any deliberate actions to reposition or push win rule blocks to build or modify the win condition. Despite the availability of rule blocks like 'key is win' and later 'ball is win', the agent never actively constructs the rule, missing strategic opportunities.","irrelevant_block_avoidance_reasoning":"There are instances where the agent moves toward and attempts to interact with rule blocks (for example, trying to approach the wall rule block to remove 'wall is stop') even when these blocks do not directly contribute, showing a lack of discriminating against irrelevant elements.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"The trajectory displays conflicting strategies—shifting between bypassing obstructions and attempting rule modifications, and switching win conditions mid-execution. This lack of a coherent, context-driven approach indicates poor context-sensitive decision making.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent clearly identifies the active win condition as evidenced by its shift in strategy when the observed win rule changes (from 'key is win' to 'ball is win') and subsequently targets the appropriate object. This shows a capacity to recognize and adjust based on the win condition.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"While the agent makes an early attempt to modify the rule by moving toward the wall rule block to break the 'wall is stop' impasse, the execution is inconsistent. Ultimately, the agent reverts to bypassing obstacles rather than effectively modifying rules to clear a path.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"The navigation strategy is inefficient; the agent undertakes multiple detours, such as repeated left and right moves and backtracking, rather than following a clear, direct path to the win target, which delays progress.","subtask_coordination_and_overall_task_planning_reasoning":"The overall strategy appears fragmented with a continual switch in focus—from trying to address obstacles via rule change to redirecting straight navigation—and an uncoordinated sequencing of actions. This lack of clear subtask planning hampers achievement of a consistent win condition.","interaction_with_immovable_obstacles_reasoning":"The agent generally avoids futile interactions with immovable objects such as walls.
