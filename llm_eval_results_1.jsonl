This meandering pattern indicates ineffective route planning that does not consistently decrease the distance to the win target.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"Despite recognizing important rule elements in the observation, the agent fails to interact with or reposition any of them. The lack of any action aimed at altering the rules—especially regarding obstacles like 'wall is stop'—demonstrates poor rule manipulation.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"The agent does not engage with key objects that could be used to form the win condition, instead opting for repeated movement commands. It shows no selective interaction with the available blocks (such as 'key', 'is', 'win') that would have been critical for solving the puzzle.","win_rule_construction":-1,"context-sensitive_decision_making":-1,"win_condition_recognition":-1,"rule_modification_for_obstacle_management":-1,"direct_navigation_efficiency":-1,"rule_manipulation_and_execution":-1,"selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects":-1}
{"win_rule_construction_reasoning":"The agent identified that the win condition was ‘door is win’ and noted that the ‘wall is stop’ rule was blocking progress, yet it never attempted to interact with or reposition any blocks to remove or modify this rule. There is no evidence of deliberate block manipulation to construct the necessary win condition, even when relevant rule blocks (like 'stop', 'door', etc.) were visible.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"Although the agent’s initial reasoning recognized that rule modification might be required, its subsequent actions were a series of repeated directional moves without evidence of adapting to the context. Instead of directly addressing the obstacle by interacting with the ‘wall is stop’ blocks or tailoring movements toward clearing the path, the agent meandered, which suggests poor context-awareness in dynamic decision making.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent correctly recognized the active win condition (‘door is win’) from its observations and mentioned it in its reasoning. This indicates that it properly interpreted the rule regarding the target needed for winning, even though its follow‐up actions did not efficiently reach the door.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"While the agent’s initial plan indicated that removal of the ‘wall is stop’ rule was necessary, its actions did not include any attempt to modify or disable that rule. The trajectory shows only navigation moves without any block manipulation to overcome the obstacle, reflecting a poor approach to rule modification for obstacle management.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"The agent’s movement was characterized by multiple, repetitive left, up, and right moves that do not appear to form a direct or efficient path to the door. The absence of a clearly direct trajectory toward the win object demonstrates inefficient route planning.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"Even though the agent recognized that interaction with the rules (specifically the 'wall is stop' rule) was necessary, no concrete action was taken to manipulate the rule blocks. The trajectory is filled with mere directional moves, without any decisive rule-changing execution, showing a failure in this aspect.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"The agent largely ignored available interactive blocks (such as the ones forming the win condition or those related to the blocking rules) and did not differentiate between objects relevant to winning and irrelevant ones. Its actions focused on navigation rather than selectively interacting with the crucial objects that would alter the game state.","win_rule_construction":-1,"context-sensitive_decision_making":-1,"win_condition_recognition":1,"rule_modification_for_obstacle_management":-1,"direct_navigation_efficiency":-1,"rule_manipulation_and_execution":-1,"selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects":-1}
{"win_rule_construction_reasoning":"The agent did not actively rearrange blocks to explicitly form or construct the win condition. The win rule 'ball is win' was already in place, and the agent never attempted to push or reorganize any of the rule blocks to build the rule. This indicates a lack of deliberate win rule construction behavior.","context-sensitive_decision_making_reasoning":"While the agent initially identified that walls were blocking the win object and that the 'wall is stop' rule had to be removed, its subsequent movement pattern is somewhat meandering. The agent alternated between left, up, and down moves without a clear, efficient, goal-directed path, reflecting an inability to fully tailor its actions to the immediate spatial context.","win_condition_recognition_reasoning":"The agent correctly recognized that the active win condition was 'ball is win' and planned to move toward the ball. The initial reasoning explicitly mentioned the win condition and identified the ball's location, showing accurate recognition.","rule_modification_for_obstacle_management_reasoning":"The agent correctly identified that the 'wall is stop' rule was an obstacle blocking the path to the win target and took actions aimed at removing it. The subsequent change in the active rules (with 'wall is stop' no longer present) suggests successful rule modification to manage the obstacle.","direct_navigation_efficiency_reasoning":"The agent’s movement was not optimally direct. Despite knowing that the ball was the goal, its actions involved several unnecessary directional changes (left, up, down, etc.) that did not consistently reduce the distance to the target, indicating inefficient route planning.","rule_manipulation_and_execution_reasoning":"The agent demonstrated an understanding of when and how to modify rules by moving in a manner intended to break the 'wall is stop' rule. The effective removal of this rule from later observations confirms that the agent executed rule manipulation appropriately.","selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects_reasoning":"Throughout the trajectory, the agent focused on relevant game elements by targeting the win condition (the ball) and ignoring other objects like the key and door, which were deemed irrelevant. This shows an appropriate focus on the essential components of the task.","win_rule_construction":-1,"context-sensitive_decision_making":-1,"win_condition_recognition":1,"rule_modification_for_obstacle_management":1,"direct_navigation_efficiency":-1,"rule_manipulation_and_execution":1,"selective_interaction_with_relevant_objects":1}
